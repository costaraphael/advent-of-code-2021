# Advent of Code 2021

Here are my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) problems.

## Repo structure

The structure of this repo is as follows:

- `/inputs/` - the inputs for each day
- 'advent_of_code_2021.livemd' - Livebook notebook with the solutions

## Running the code

You can run the solutions by starting Livebook in this directory and then opening the notebook with the solutions:

```sh
livebook server --root-path $(pwd) --open
```

Alternatively, you can just start Livebook somewhere and click the "Run in Livebook" badge below.
